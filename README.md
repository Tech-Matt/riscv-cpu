# riscv-cpu
A RISC-V non pipelined RV32I cpu implementation in VHDL, using AMD Vivado Software.

Read Github [Wiki](https://github.com/Tech-Matt/riscv-cpu/wiki) for more details.

## Overview
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d14bb4e3-7c2d-4a18-9439-53f07ec98cef)

The CPU I will implement will have the following properties:
- Support for a subset of RV32I;
- 31 general purpose registers (32 bit), 1 program counter;
- Harvard Architecture;
- Instruction Memory implemented as a single port ROM BRAM;
- Data Memory Implemented as a single port RAM BRAM;

## Implemented Instructions
For now I am going to implement a small subset of the RV32I ISA. This is a comprehensive list:

## Instruction Memory
Instruction memory will consist of a ROM BRAM (Read only memory Block RAM), with a width of 32 bits (instruction size, RISC-V like) and a depth of 4096 instructions. The block memory is defined as a single port ROM, that's because we are only interested in reading the hardcoded RISC-V instructions inside of it. The BRAM will have an enable pin and a synchronous reset pin (will only work when memory is enabled). 
The IP will have an embedded output register where the Instruction to be decoded is saved before the instruction decode stage.
The input address is 32 bit wide to ease RISC-V jump instructions. For this time the load_en for the instruction memory will be hard-wired to "1".

## Register File
Register File is made of a DRAM (Distributed Memory), with two ports, defined with a width of 32 bits (RISC-V Registers size) and 32 words deep (RISC-V ISA defines 32 registers for the register file). For now the **output** is registered.

## Data Memory
Data Memory will be implemented as a single port RAM BRAM, with 32 bit width and 4096 blocks of depth. Made of 4096 words of 32 bits. Address is 12 bits. write_en generated by control state machine.

## Clock
Clock is now set at 50 MHz. Testing need to be done.

## Instruction Fetch Stage

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8700b4ea-cb5c-4315-8663-80a18aff4140)

The entire instruction fetch stage is executed in one clock cycle. Here is the flow of operations:

- If LOAD_EN is active, incoming PC from upper stages is loaded into the PC register (beware, this happens 1 clock cycle before the start of the instruction fetch)
- Rising edge of the clock arrives
- BRAM Instruction Memory fetches instruction reading PC if LOAD_EN_MEM is active. A synchronous RST may reset the Instruction Memory
- In the meantime PC + 4 is computed and saved in NPC (Next Program Counter)
- BRAM will save Instruction in internal IR (instruction register) before the arrival of the next clock pulse

## Instruction Decode Stage
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/443186e3-aafc-49e8-b343-46ff2ccb3d1a)

**The Instruction Decode (ID)** stage is responsible for interpreting the fetched instruction. It extracts the necessary control signals and operands required for the Execute stage. This stage reads the instruction, decodes it, reads the necessary register values, and generates immediate values and control signals.

**Decoder Block**
The Decoder block is part of the Instruction Decode stage. It takes a 32-bit instruction and extracts relevant fields such as opcode, func3, func7, and register addresses. Based on the opcode and func3, it generates control signals and immediate values.

## Execution Stage
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84ad0f9f-7cd6-40b8-9843-60cffdd58f85)

The Execution stage is responsible for performing arithmetic and logical operations, as well as evaluating branch conditions. It takes operands from the previous stage, applies the necessary operations using the ALU and comparator components, and outputs the results and branch conditions.

- **Inputs:**
  - `clk`: The clock signal.
  - `rs1_val`: The value of the first source register.
  - `rs2_val`: The value of the second source register.
  - `immediate`: The 32-bit immediate value.
  - `cond_opcode`: The conditional operation code.
  - `alu_opcode`: The ALU operation code.
  - `pc`: The program counter value.
  - `a_sel`: Control signal for selecting between `pc` and `rs1_val` for the ALU.
  - `b_sel`: Control signal for selecting between `immediate` and `rs2_val` for the ALU.

- **Outputs:**
  - `branch_cond`: The branch condition output.
  - `alu_pre_result`: The intermediate ALU result.
  - `alu_result`: The final ALU result.

The Execution stage uses two main components: the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) and the comparator. The ALU performs arithmetic and logical operations based on the `alu_opcode`, while the comparator evaluates branch conditions based on the `cond_opcode`. Multiplexers controlled by `a_sel` and `b_sel` are used to select the appropriate operands for the ALU.

## Memory and Write Back Stage
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eacd144e-27fc-4129-b8ec-fc4e82c3cdfc)

The Memory and Write Back stage is responsible for accessing the data memory and writing back the results to the destination registers. It handles memory read/write operations and updates the program counter based on the operation type and branch conditions.

- **Inputs:**
  - `clk`: The clock signal.
  - `branch_cond`: Branch condition signal.
  - `next_pc`: The next program counter value.
  - `alu_result`: The result from the ALU.
  - `alu_pre_result`: The intermediate ALU result.
  - `op_class`: Operation class indicating the type of operation.
  - `mem_we`: Memory write enable signal.
  - `rs2_val`: The value of the second source register.
  - `rsta`: Asynchronous reset for the memory.

- **Outputs:**
  - `pc_out`: The updated program counter value.
  - `rd_value`: The value to be written back to the destination register.

The Memory and Write Back stage uses a data memory component for reading from and writing to memory. It also includes multiplexers to determine the correct values for the program counter and the destination register based on the operation class and branch conditions.

<ins> Max Priority </ins>

<ins> Normal </ins>
- [ ] Remember to pur default variable value everywhere, otherwise latches could be inferred
- [ ] Write table of signals for instruction fetch
- [ ] Write table of signals for instruction decode
- [ ] Create alu_opcode table

<ins> To be done one day in the future </ins>
- [ ] Chose a standard for variables in vhdl, uppercase or lowercase?
- [ ] See in instruction decode if it is best to keep std_logic_vector for some signals, or change it to unsigned
- [ ] See if concurrent execution can be converted to processes or vice versa
- [ ] You could add flags to alu operations
