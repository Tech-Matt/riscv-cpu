## Todo

<ins> Max Priority </ins>

- [ ] Write Instruction Decode
- [ ] Do an Instruction Decode testbench
- [ ] Draw Instruction Decode Structure

<ins> Normal </ins>
- [ ] See in instruction decode if it is best to keep std_logic_vector for some signals, or change it to unsigned
- [ ] Write Wiki for instruction Decode

<ins> To be done one day in the future </ins>
- [ ] Chose a standard for variables in vhdl, uppercase or lowercase?
- [ ] Write table of signals for instruction fetch
- [ ] Write table of signals for instruction decode
